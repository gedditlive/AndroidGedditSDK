## Get Started

### Installation

#### Gradle

Add the following dependency to your `app.gradle` file:

```kotlin
implementation 'com.geddit.live.sdk:core:1.0.14'(Version may vary)
implementation 'com.geddit.live.sdk:commerce:1.0.21'(Version may vary)
```

### Initialize Commerce SDK

```kotlin
val sdk = GedditLiveCommerce.Builder(
    context,
    "12359616-26f7-4b21-9e26-2ce766d5c6ed",
    "ba822b68b152f015730380224c525021",
    "12345",
    "TestUser",
    "THB",
    object: GedditLiveCommerce.GedditLiveCommerceListener {
        override fun onCollectionImageClicked(context: Context, product: Product) {
            
        }
        override fun onCollectionAddToBagClicked(context: Context, product: Product) {
            
        }
        override fun onReady(helper:  GedditLiveCommerce.GedditLiveCommerceActionListener) {
            
        }
    },
    object: VoucherDelegate {
        override fun didWinVoucher(voucher: Voucher) {
            // Called when user won a voucher.
        }
    },
    object : QuizDelegate {
        override fun didAnswerCorrectlyQuestion(question: String, answer: String) {
            // Called when user answered correctly.

        }
        override fun didAnswerIncorrectlyQuestion(question: String, answer: String) {
            // Called when user answered incorrectly.
        }
    }
    )
    .email("test@gmail.com")
    .gender(Gender.MALE)
    .mobileNumber("+66612345678")
    .languageCode("en")
    .fcmToken("")
    .debuggable(BuildConfig.DEBUG)
    
GedditLiveCommerce.with(sdk.build())
```

### Display Live Stream

```kotlin
GedditLiveCommerce.with(sdk.build())
```

### Close Live Stream

```kotlin
GedditHelper.helper?.dismissLiveStream()
```

### Picture In Picture

#### Expand To Go Back To Live Stream View

```kotlin
GedditHelper.helper?.exitPIP()
```

#### Enter PIP View

```kotlin
GedditHelper.helper?.enterPIP()
```

## Delegate

### Product View Delegate

`GedditLiveCommerceListener` allows you to create your custom product view and manage its life cycle.

```kotlin
{
    override fun onCollectionImageClicked(context: Context, product: Product) {
        
    }
    override fun onCollectionAddToBagClicked(context: Context, product: Product) {
        
    }
    override fun onReady(helper: GedditLiveCommerceActionListener) {
        
    }
}
```

You can initialize the SDK with your product delegate implementation.

```kotlin
    object: GedditLiveCommerce.GedditLiveCommerceListener {
        override fun onCollectionImageClicked(context: Context, product: Product) {
            
        }
        override fun onCollectionAddToBagClicked(context: Context, product: Product) {
            
        }
        override fun onReady(helper:  GedditLiveCommerce.GedditLiveCommerceActionListener) {
            
        }
    }
```

### Picture In Picture Delegate

`GedditLiveCommerceActionListener` allows you to control when picture in picture view is
closed or tapped.

```kotlin
{
     override fun enterPIP() {
     
     }
     override fun exitPIP() {
     
     }
     override fun exitPIP(product: Product) {
     
     }
}
```

You can call  PIP delegate implementation.

```kotlin
GedditLiveCommerce.helper?.enterPIP()
```

By default clicking on PIP brings you to the live stream and closing the PIP causes closing 
SDK. If you want to change this behaviour, please conform to 
`GedditLiveCommerceActionListener`.

### Voucher Delegate

`GedditCommerceVoucherDelegate` allows you to get called back when user won a voucher.

```kotlin
{
    override fun didWinVoucher(voucher: Voucher) {
        // Called when user won a voucher.
    }
}
```

You can initialize SDK with your voucher delegate implementation.

```kotlin
 object: VoucherDelegate {
        override fun didWinVoucher(voucher: Voucher) {
            // Called when user won a voucher.
        }
    }
```
